# Fancy_Augmentation_and_Classification
Tool for creating a balanced dataset, augmenting it in the classic way, and then using it to train StyleGAN3. Once the StyleGAN 3 has been trained, it will be used to generate synthetic images, which will allow to increase the images available to train an MMClassification classifier (EfficientNET-B4).

Before discussing the steps, let's say that the repository is divided into two parts: the first dedicated to the reproduction of the result obtained with StyleGAN3, the second dedicated to the reproduction of the result with MMClassification.
